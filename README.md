The R code 02.imd_grd_nc.R gives the conversion of the Indian Meteorological Department(IMD) daily temperature data from the GRD file to CSV files and then to the NC file. The converted IMD data is a grid-level data with a 1-degree by 1-degree grid resolution with both maximum and minimum temperatures reported daily. In this code, I have converted for four years, namely from 2020 to 2023. However, the code can easily be replicated for other years and can be used to create a bigger panel. Since the code converts to both CSV and NC files, it is flexible for the users and can be used according to their needs.
